# **PyBer_Analysis**
---
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. This report includes a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. ... used in this process were Pandas and Matplotlib.
---
## Results
- The urban cities by far have the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fares. However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. On the contrary, rural cities have the lowest total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Rural cities also have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Suburban cities ride-sharing data falls in between urban and rural cities. Exact values are displayed below:

 - All three city type fares seem to peak at the end of February, and drop back just before March. Between March and April, the rural and suburban city fares stay fairly consistant, where as urban fares fluctuate as show in the figure below:

## Summary
Based on these results, I would recommend increasing ride-sharing advertisment in late January and early February in anticipation of the peak in fares at the end of February. To boost fare sales between March and April, I would recommend implementing discounts on fare rates. Lastley, I recommend maximizing rural and suburban ride fares while urban ride fares dip and are inconsitant.
